		About me:
	</h2>

	<p>
		I am a new programmer that codes in Python and C++ and is also learning a bit of html/css to make this website. I first started with 
		Python and then moved onto C++. I am not very good which is one of the reasons why I made the <a href="https://github.com/Skeletron3/GEC-Project" target="_blank">GEC-Project</a>. I usually code in my
		free time and have an interest in making software and learning more about coding.
